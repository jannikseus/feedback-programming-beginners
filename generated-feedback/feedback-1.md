## Feedback 1

### Documentation
_"[Tool 1] analyzes a given class or project for class design by using well-known object-oriented metrics.
This [tool] generates feedback when the given classes or methods violate previously set boundaries (lower/upper thresholds) of these metrics.
The feedback can be customized as well."_

### Output
### In class `eu.qped.java.utils.compiler.src.booking.MainBooking.java`

**CAM (Cohesion Among Methods Of Class)** measured with value: `0.16666666666666666`

This class and their methods are or are close to being un-cohesive. Assimilate methods in your class in order to increase readability and decrease complexity at once.

### In class `eu.qped.java.utils.compiler.src.booking.MainBooking.java`

**CBO (Coupling Between Object Classes)** measured with value: `18.0`

The sum of all class couplings in this class is too high, which means too many interdependencies, coordination and information flow between them. Try to minimize these dependencies from this class to other classes. Also, refer to afferent/efferent coupling metric.

### In class `eu.qped.java.utils.compiler.src.booking.MainBooking.java`

**CC (McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity)** measured with value: `12.0`

For method `private static eu.qped.java.utils.compiler.src.booking.DiscountValue evaluateDiscountValue(eu.qped.java.utils.compiler.src.booking.DiscountType discountType, java.time.LocalDateTime now)`:
This method in the given class is too complex, too many paths are taken (ite-statements). Try to decrease the complexity by delegating functionalities into other methods or classes.

### In class `eu.qped.java.utils.compiler.src.booking.MainBooking.java`

**CE (Efferent Coupling)** measured with value: `18.0`

This class is using too many other classes. Can some functionalities be joined by other classes or even be implemented in this specific class?

### In class `eu.qped.java.utils.compiler.src.booking.MainBooking.java`

**LOC (Lines Of Code)** measured with value: `334.0`

This class contains too many lines of code, it could be considered as a "God Class". Try to keep only the main functionality in this class, others should be implemented into other (new) classes.
